# Trip-Planner
Trip Planning API Project for Data Structures and Algorithms

Features --
Trip Planner offers the following features:
Routing: Users can enter their starting and destination points, and the program will generate the optimal route based on distance.
Search: Users can search for nearby attractions allowing them to plan their trips in detail.
Locate-all: Users can find the positions of all points-of-interest in a given category.
Plan-route: Users can find the shortest path from a starting position to a named point-of-interest.
Find-nearby: Users can find up to n points-of-interest in a given category nearest to a starting position.

Technology --
Trip Planner is implemented in DSSL2, a domain-specific language designed for modeling
and solving optimization programs. The program utilizes various algorithms to generate optimal routes,
search for nearby locations, and locate all points-of-interest in a given category.

Installation --
To use Trip Planner, you will need to download and install Dr. Racket 8.7 and install the DSSL2 language
